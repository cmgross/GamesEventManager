Games Event Manager
========
My wife and I are amateur Highland Games athletes.
That means wearing a kilt, throwing big rocks and flipping trees end over end while wearing a kilt.
It also means community, family, and exercise that is fun and challenging.

It's always been a challenge communicating the information about when the events were, how far away they are for friends and family that want to spectate
(or participate themselves!), and how to get there.

I created this simple site to gather all of the information for friends and family in one spot, so that they could easily see upcoming games close to them.
